**** Details
- cycle :: For biomassings on pasture, cycle gives an estimate of when in the season the biomassing was taken. This value is used to help estimate the total forage availability. Each cycle is roughly considered 30 days.
- tenday :: For biomassings on pasture, tenday gives a finer estimate of when in the season the biomassing was taken, numerically, in 10 day increments starting early-May to October depending on the year. This serves a similar purpose to pasture cycle, but is used in the calculation of forage availability. See

**** Data Details
- =yielding_type= :: type of yield in this table is all biomassing, but needed for checking exclusive typing.
  + biomassing - taking a measurement with the goal of inferring yield or mass from larger area. Observations are generally clearly one or the other, but small harvests may conceptually be similar. For such cases, biomassings should be limited to be less than 1000 sq ft.
  + harvesting - all product is taken off the field
- =method= :: Technique of how biomassing was taken
  + /quadrat/ - taking a biomass by manually sampling above ground from small area, normally within a quadrat
  + /undercutting/ - drawing blade through the soil, for either shoots or roots. This practice was more common between 2014-2019, and stopped in preference for quadratting for less soil disturbance
- =component= :: the portion of the plant that was biomassed.
  + roots - underground portion
