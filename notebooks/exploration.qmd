```{r}
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
wicst_raw <- read_excel(here("data-raw/2024-09-06 WICST_Master_Data - ML.xlsx")) 
```

```{r}
skim(wicst_raw)
```

```{r}
wicst_raw$crop1 |> unique()
wicst_raw |> 
  count(year, crop1)
# fc = filler corn
# c = corn
# direct seeded alfalfa
# oatlage
```

## By the variables

### Site

```{r}
xtabs(~year + site, data = wicst_raw)
wicst_raw |> count(year, site) |> pivot_wider(names_from = )
```

### System

Let's go backwards by year... 

```{r}
xtabs(~system + year, data = wicst_raw)
# wicst_raw |> 
#   count(year, system)
```

### Block

```{r}
xtabs(~year + block + site, data = wicst_raw)
```

4 blocks every year.

```{r}
wicst_raw |> 
  filter(site == "ARL", year %in% c(2002)) |> 
  xtabs(~block + system, data = _)
xtabs(~block + site, data = wicst_raw)
```

It looks like every part of the growing cycle is represented every year?

```{r}
# corn siulage
wicst_raw$crop1 |> unique()
wicst_raw |> filter(crop1 == "past") |> count(system)

wicst_raw |>
  filter(crop1 %in% c("c silage", "c_silage")) |> 
  count(year, crop1)
```

```{r}
# system 1: fc and c.

wicst_raw |> 
  filter(system == 1, crop1 == "fc") |> count(year)
```

```{r}
# system 3: 
wicst_raw |> 
  filter(system == 3) |>
  select(year, crop1, crop2, crop3) |>
  distinct(year, crop1, crop2, crop3) |> 
  xtabs(~year + crop1, data = _)

# extra wg in 1994? why

wicst_raw |> filter(system == 3, year == 1994) |> 
  select(year, block, crop1, crop2, crop3, system) |> 
  filter(crop1 == "wg")

xtabs(~ year + block +  system, data = wicst_raw)

wicst_raw |> count(year, block, system) |> 
  filter(system == 3) |> arrange()

wicst_raw |>
  filter(between(year, 1994, 1995), system == 3) |> 
  arrange(site, year, block)
  

wicst_raw |> 
  filter(between(year, 1994, 1995), system == 3) |> 
  xtabs(~year + crop3 + site, data = _)

# 1994, system 3, at LAC, one of them
  
wicst_raw |> distinct(crop1, crop2, crop3, crop4) |> 
  arrange(crop1) |> 
  rownames_to_column(var = "treatment_id")

wicst_raw |> filter(year == 1989, system == 3)
  
```

can we track crop rotation in a single plot?

```{r}
wicst_raw |> filter(system == 2, plot == 108)
  
```
