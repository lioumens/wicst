*** REVISIT Biofuels
**** IGNORED 2023 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- template
**** DONE 2023_biofuels_yield.xlsx
- copied both
**** IGNORED 2023_biofuels_harvest_rawdata.xlsx
- duplicated in yield
*** DONE Fall ANPP
**** DONE Alfalfa ANPP Fall 2023.xlsx
- L10 Weights has an inconsistent bag weight, 43.34 instead of 44.34 for bag 1
- 1 m^2 quadrat
- record both weeds and alfalfa dry matter, (tilled back under)
- record raw weight harvests and bags ins eparate table
- zero out the weed dm that's negative
**** DONE Fall ANPP in CS3 Wheat.xlsx
- AD25 looks incorrect, fixed, but change in yield by 15g
- also 1m^2 quadrat, needs to be added
*** DONE Pasture
**** DONE 2023_pasture_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** IGNORED Pasture Exclosure Data.xlsx
- duplicated in yields
**** IGNORED Pasture Exclosure Raw Data.xlsx
- duplicated in yields
*** DONE RRL exports
- all ready for import into R anyway, done for this stage, revisit later?
*** REVIEW Forages
**** IGNORED _Old
**** DONE 2023_alfalfa_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** REVIEW [#C] 2023_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- everything else copied
- 1 line in core,22.5 * 2000 for harvest yield? where does this come from?
**** IGNORED Corn silage harvest datasheet.xlsx
- just template
**** DONE Oatlage bale weights.xlsx
*** REVIEW Grains
**** REVIEW [#B] 2023_WICST_wheat_yields.xlsx
- looks identical... mostly extra pivot charts than aschank
- copied
- [ ] "barley filler" in =Harvest data - Grain= sheet
**** REVIEW [#C] 2023_WICST_wheat_yields (aschank@wisc.edu).xlsx
- ignore?
**** DONE 2023_WICST_soybean_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
- one comment to keep in data
**** DONE 2023_WICST_corn_grain_yields.xlsx
- copied main harvest sheet
**** REVIEW [#C] PROJ 2023_WICST_corn_grain_yields - grs.xlsx
- ignore?
- looks like copy of corn grain yields, with few extra calculations by greg
** 2022 [16/23]
*** IGNORED Fall ANPP
**** TODO WICST Fall 2022 CS1 CS2 CS3 SI CC ANPP.xlsx
**** TODO Alfalfa ANPP 2022.xlsx
**** TODO Cover Crop CS3 w_cl_o ANPP 2022.xlsx
**** IGNORED WICST Fall 2022 CC ANPP Canopeo Datasheet.xlsx
- template
**** IGNORED WICST Fall 2022 CC ANPP Datasheet.xlsx
- template
*** Forages
**** DONE Hay_Cut_Weights.xlsx
- convert tons to lbs
- assumed second sheet was cutting 2
- added columns for trailers
**** DONE 2022_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** DONE 2022_WICST_alfalfa_yields.xlsx
- converted tons to lbs, discarded original and duplicated columns, and summary columns
**** DONE 2022_WICST_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- WICST_SI info is duplicated in the WICST_core sheet, so second sheet is ignored
**** IGNORED 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yields.xlsx
- this seems like a complete duplicate of 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx in the grains folder
**** TODO [#A] Hand-harvested second cut DSA.xlsx
- they're .5^2 quadrats that were cut, 1m by .5m likely
**** REVIEW [#B] 2022 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- What is portage?
  - ignore for now..
- 115 is ignored for now.. but maybe eventually
- did not add any of these sheets yet
- length width are missing for many of these
*** Grains
**** IGNORED Soy Grain Harvest 2022 datasheet.xlsx
- template
**** IGNORED 2022 Corn Grain Harvest Datasheet.xlsx
- template
**** REVISIT 2022_WICST_corn_grain_yields.xlsx
- some constant used in final calculations, plot size and fraction of whole plot etc
- need to incorporate some comments from the excel sheet
- deleting "calculated moisture" (avg was 23.1)
- Lexi Schank: "Some area was lost from this plot due to excessive weed growth, cultivator blight, or other confounding factors. Since we can't confirm that all of this loss is from the data section, we used the following formula to correct the area used for the yield calculation: (area of data section) * (1 - (loss area / full plot area)) = 'area excluding potential loss'"
- Gregg Sanford: "missing grab sample, used average moisture" from blocks 1-3
- Lexi Schank: "We used a different area (4 rows instead of 6) due to loss in typical data section. This is reflected in the 'width' and therefore calculated into area and yield"
**** REVIEW [#C] 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx
- "weights recorded for main plots included the trailer weight, and the only distinction we have for which one was used is a color description. I averaged the weights of each of the red bale wagons as well as the black bale wagons, and got the same value. I will subtract this value from the plot weight (applies to mains only) - Lexi Schank"
- save wagon weight in table? not needed right...?
- red/black wagon weights calculated and copied into separate columns
- average yield dm excludes barley
- "Weight of specific wagon not recorded, color noted. Used average weight of all AARS 'red' or 'black' wagons for calculation."
**** DONE 2022_WICST_soybean_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** DONE 2022_WICST_wheat_grain_yields.xlsx
- comments to columns
- deleted teh calculated column, missing moisture was 16.3
**** IGNORED Corn Loss 2022.xlsx
- duplicated in corn grain yields
*** DONE Pastures
**** IGNORED Pasture Exclosure Data Sheet.xlsx
- template
**** DONE 2022_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- comments to column
