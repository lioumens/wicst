** 2022 [23/23]
*** DONE Fall ANPP
**** DONE WICST Fall 2022 CS1 CS2 CS3 SI CC ANPP.xlsx
- I don't want to do bag weights.... they're coded in individual cells for all of them... not worth recording in db imo
- split into canopeo and evaluation above
- dashes assumed to be missing and 0's assumed to be zero yield, verified like half of them, and they seemed intentional
**** DONE Alfalfa ANPP 2022.xlsx
- easy copy, split into 2022_anpp_alfalfa and 2022_anpp_alfalfa_canopeo
**** DONE Cover Crop CS3 w_cl_o ANPP 2022.xlsx
- sheet 1 seems duplicate, but copied dates from there into first sheet
- pretty straight forward, but has the #value! problem, probably need to make those NA and do lots of pivots in code
**** IGNORED WICST Fall 2022 CC ANPP Canopeo Datasheet.xlsx

**** DONE 2022_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** DONE 2022_WICST_alfalfa_yields.xlsx
- converted tons to lbs, discarded original and duplicated columns, and summary columns
**** DONE 2022_WICST_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- WICST_SI info is duplicated in the WICST_core sheet, so second sheet is ignored
**** IGNORED 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yields.xlsx
- this seems like a complete duplicate of 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx in the grains folder
**** DONE [#A] Hand-harvested second cut DSA.xlsx
- they're .5^2 quadrats that were cut, 1m by .5m likely
- add a note that just says "late harvest", hand sample ignored
**** DONE [#B] 2022 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- conclusion: use the N/S averages for width. Fill in with existing values 63.7. For 2022 and 2023, use 10 minimum, and 19 for plots with double passes.
- length width are missing for many of these, need to ask if fill in or leave harvest area blank
- What is portage?
  - ignore for now..
- 115 is ignored for now.. but maybe eventually
- did not add any of these sheets yet
- saved them into =2022_harvest_prairie_wicst/115/portage= for now

**** DONE 2022_WICST_corn_grain_yields.xlsx
- conclusions logged in readme, for loss design
- some constant used in final calculations, plot size and fraction of whole plot etc
- need to incorporate some comments from the excel sheet
- deleting "calculated moisture" (avg was 23.1)
- Lexi Schank: "Some area was lost from this plot due to excessive weed growth, cultivator blight, or other confounding factors. Since we can't confirm that all of this loss is from the data section, we used the following formula to correct the area used for the yield calculation: (area of data section) * (1 - (loss area / full plot area)) = 'area excluding potential loss'"
- Gregg Sanford: "missing grab sample, used average moisture" from blocks 1-3
- Lexi Schank: "We used a different area (4 rows instead of 6) due to loss in typical data section. This is reflected in the 'width' and therefore calculated into area and yield"
**** DONE [#C] 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx
- "weights recorded for main plots included the trailer weight, and the only distinction we have for which one was used is a color description. I averaged the weights of each of the red bale wagons as well as the black bale wagons, and got the same value. I will subtract this value from the plot weight (applies to mains only) - Lexi Schank"
- save wagon weight in table? not needed right...?
- red/black wagon weights calculated and copied into separate columns
- average yield dm excludes barley
- "Weight of specific wagon not recorded, color noted. Used average weight of all AARS 'red' or 'black' wagons for calculation."
**** DONE 2022_WICST_soybean_yields.xlsx

**** DONE 2021_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- I think I should use these numbers, because there's rounding differences in FORAGe_YIELDS. it's copied over and there's only 2 decimal accurace. This data sheet
- mysterious red numbers ignored
- The DM for the massive pllot seems to come from nowhere... also the plot width is different in this file
**** DONE 2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx
- Alfalfa section was just copied.
- corn silage part is conflicting "2021_harvests_corn_silage_main", can delete the entire sheet if not correct bc the pdf file seems to match the numbers in SI (the other file)
**** REVIEW [#A] 2021_WICST_SI_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- [ ] Is width 5 or 15 though? 5 in master/yields. 15 in “trusted” source
- conclusion is to use the pdf one
- there are yields here that conflict with [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]], not sure which ones to use for the main plots
- the pdf file seems to match this one though
- rounding propogation in the pasture section, so using the source datafile
**** IGNORED Alfalfa-2021.xlsx
- ignored because it looks duplicated
- copied
**** DONE [#B] Corn_Silage_Map_Weights.pdf
- ask about the filler corn & the plot width 410.
- ignored for now.. unless they want to point out the important info to capture here.
- theres filler corn numbers here I don't see elsewhere, and the total?
**** DONE [#C] CS3_Straw-2021.xlsx
- replace with wet bag weight, so that we get rid of negative moistures
- information seems duplicated in [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]]
- ignored
- negative moistures need to resolve

**** Soybean
***** DONE 2021_WICST_Soybean_yields.xlsx
- same question about adjusting for loss across entire field, the denominator
- template ignored...
- added column for harvest loss, but need to split into assesed area, and direct loss (systematic)
**** Corn Grain
***** DONE 2021_WICST_Corn_Grain_Yields.xlsx
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2024-11-01 Fri 09:00] \\
  i think the conclusion was to disregard the filler stuff, since it's just numbers that they needed to report, but not part of experiment
:END:
- need to ask about filler in these spreadsheets? whether we want to keep track, lots of missing values
- copied in, added column for harvest loss in m2, unmerged silage rows and added column
- fixed date and harvest loss percentage of plot
- why is the denominator of the harvest loss by 60'x510' not 30'x510'. it seems like that they didn't know what region the loss happened, so assumed it was evenly spread out along both. (systematic)
- i think the conclusion was to exclude the filler corn stuff

*** Alfalfa/Oat data
- the oats harvest file only has the dry weight, and the percent moisture in master uses .5
- some of the moistures only appear in this file, so using the ones I found. If multiple, they all correspond well.
*** Wheat Straw
- there's a conflict with the straw file, but num bales match up, its "SM STRAW", but this file looks more legit,so I used these values

** DONE 2013_harvests_straw
** DONE 2013_harvests_pasture
- There's a missing plot number here, and some conflicting data files. I think =WICST CS6 Hay Exclosure Harvests 2013= gives the best picture of what happenend, on the =Full plot= sheet.
- Originally I was told to split just the 5620 (wagon 1), but i think itmakes more sense to do all three wagons, as the numbers look more reasonable
- It looks like they chopped everything from all 4 plots, and measured everything into 3 wagons. Master only shows the first measurement from wagon 1. Then I think they took only 1 grab sample from plot 405, and the row got mislabeled in the sheet. That's why they calculate the average the way they do.

- [ ] plot 302 doesn't have a harvest date on the ag cal (pasture), but it has lbs. while 112 does have a line on the agcal but missing lbs? are these real?
  - master seems to have entries, but from another file comment says "source exclosure hay ylds_2004_2012.xlsx", so mix of exclosure data etc
** REVIEW [#A] 2009
- [ ] I suspect a copy paste error with the multipliers from 2008. There _are_ losses there e.g. 1.545 multiplier was 510x60 with 2400 sqft loss. but they appear again in the sheet without any comments. I'm fairly certain that these are incorrect, maybe correct

*** Database Development Narrative
- we biodata vault ->
- arlington yields
- link R code for changes
*** Yield Changes from Master
**** 1990
**** 1991
- Plots 103, 213, 314, 410 (oat grain) originally used ideal moisture value of 13%, database now uses 14% for consistency, resulting in a 1.2% increase in final yield for all plots.
**** 1995
- Plot 409 was noted as missing, but notes in master indicate that these are true 0's. "plot mistakenly killed last fall; missing value". All cuts for this plot are recorded as 0's, with intended harvest dates same as the replicates.
**** 1998
- plot 114 (oatlage): Recalculation of yield from raw data results in yield that are half of the original master data sheet. Yield was changed from 3.69 -> 1.846 t dm/acre, a 50% reduction. Original calculation is hypothesized to have accidently used half the harvest area.
- plot 211 (oatlage): Recalculation of yield from raw data results in yield that are half of the original master data sheet. Yield was changed from 4.938 -> 2.47 t dm/acre, a 50% reduction. Original calculation is hypothesized to have accidently used half the harvest area.
- plot 312 (oatlage): Recalculation of yield from raw data results in yield that are half of the original master data sheet. Yield was changed from 3.62-> 1.81 t dm/acre, a 50% reduction. Original calculation is hypothesized to have accidently used half the harvest area.
- plot 403 (oatlage): Recalculation of yield from raw data results in yield that are half of the original master data sheet. Yield was changed from 4.91 -> 2.46 t dm/acre, a 50% reduction. Original calculation is hypothesized to have accidently used half the harvest area.
**** 1999
- Plot 106 (soybean): had a yield value of 33 bu/acre without supporting raw data information. Moisture information originally had used the ideal moisture of 13.5, so the value was also deleted. This yield value was not maintained, and is a missing entry with intended harvest date imputed from the replicates.
**** 2002
- plot 206 (corn): 3000 additional sqft of loss accounted for, increasing yield from 125.68 -> 156.34 bu/acre, 25% increase
- plot 204 (corn): 250 additional sqft of loss accounted for, increasing yield from 205.6 -> 209.0 bu/acre, 1.6% increase
- plot 113 (corn): 1275 harvest area loss accounted for based on comments. Originally, only 682.55 of loss was accounted for (deduced from a yield multiplier of 2.98). Increases yield from 169.72 -> 176.89 bu/acre, 4.2% increase
**** 2004
- Plots 106, 202, 307, 411, 110, 208, 304, 413 (snaplage): These plots were harvested as snaplage, and converted to bu/acre with Joe Lauer equations. These are now labeled as snaplage, and saved as t dm/acre with accompanying moisture values.
**** 2005
- plot 404 (dsa): new entry is unrounded, and recalculated from raw data. Original value recorded was round to two decimal places originally, and because of low yield, unrounded value is greater than 1.1% decrease in yield.
**** 2006
- Plot 206 (corn): moisture and (best guess) of harvest area was restored, but raw data value for harvest lbs of 1780 lbs was not restored because of low confidence in the number being accurate. The yield number would have been 144.36 bu/acre, low compared to other corn reps this year.
**** 2008
- plot 204 (corn): originally excluded because plot mostly flooded. Values for moisture and area harvested were restored for record of flood loss, but raw data value of 422 was determined to be too inacurrate to include. The raw data would have resulted in 63.5 bu/acre, too low compared to average of 141 bu/acre of other reps even accounting for estimated loss. Estimated loss is retained for record of flood event.
**** 2009
- Plot 307 (wheat grain): Originally considered missing data because of winterkill that did not get reseeded in time. This harvest is now explicitly coded as 0 as it's known there was no yield. Intended harvest date was copied from other reps.
- Plots 111, 209, 305, 409 (corn): All plots from system 4 phase 1 had misapplied herbicide carryover that killed corn. After replanting, these plots were harvested as corn silage and converted to grain yield. We undo this conversion and instead store the corn silage raw data in the database.
- Plots 210 (cuts 2-4), 203 (cuts 2-4), 208 (all cuts), alfalfa: There was a suspected copy-paste error for excel formulas that was corrected. Arlington yields used a "yield multiplier" to calculate final yield, but the multipliers used in 2009 were the same as 2008. In 2008, there was a commented 2400 sqft loss (multiplier of 1.545), but the comment does not appear in 2009. The formula multiplier of 1.545 was originally used in the same relative cell positions as the sheet in 2008, but show up in different plots. Oddly, the "master file" and "arlington" already differed for cut 1 in 210 and 203, so there's technically no change to these cuts relative to the master sheet (but relative to the arlington sheet there is).
- Plot 213 (alfalfa, cut 2): A similar copy-paste error in master sheet. A flood loss of 14400 sqft was recorded in this cell position in 2008 but there is no comment for 2009 of such loss. The arlington sheet here seems correct, and was likely copied into master incorrectly. This changes the final yield from 1.28 -> .68 t dm/acre, a 47% reduction.
**** 2010
- Plot 106 (corn): Originally had a yield of 185.55 bu/acre in the master sheet but was unable to reproduce this number with raw data found. Recalculations with raw data found in the arlington sheet gives a final yield of 183.6 bu/acre, a decrease of ~1% in final yield.
- Plot 305 (alfalfa): Originally labeled as the "second crop" as this plot had to be reseeded due to herbicide. It's now labeled as the "first" crop of the plot for this year since originally the first was non-existent.
**** 2012
- plot 102 (soybean): A gap of 325 sqft was originally unaccounted for. The yield changed from 47.47 -> 48.51 bu/acre, an increase of 2.2% after accounting for the planting gap.
**** 2013
- plot 206 (soybean): The plot length was adjusted from 514.875 -> 510 for yield calculation for consistency. The yield changed from 57.23 -> 57.86 bu/acre, an increase of 1.1%.
- plot 310 (soybean): The plot length was adjusted from 515.5 -> 510 for consistency with other years. The yield changed from 58.3 -> 58.9 bu/acre, an increase of 1.1 % after accounting for the planting gap.
- plot 408 (soybean): The plot length was adjusted from 516.5 -> 510 for consistency with other years. The yield changed from 58.9 -> 59.7 bu/acre, an increase of 1.3 % after accounting for the planting gap.
- plot 401 (corn): The plot length was adjusted from 518 -> 510 for yield calculation for consistency, resulting in a yield change of 212.7 -> 215.8 bu/acre, a 1.4% change

**** 2015
- Plot 209, 305, 409 (cut 1, alfalfa): Copy paste error suspected, moisture values for these plots are from RRL csv. Ordering in RRL export file was 409, 209, 305, and order of moistures may have been swapped. Assuming labeling in RRL export file is correct, the moisture values for these plots were originally swapped. The resulting moisture changes for 209, 305, and 409 are 54.8 -> 53.3, 53.27 -> 49.8, 49.8 -> 54.8 respectively, resulting in a change in final yield of 3.4%, 7.4% and 9.9%.
- Plot 103, 213, 314, 410 (oatlage):  Moisture values were orginially all imputed at 50%. These have been removed for storage in the database.
**** 2016
- Plot 102 (wheat grain): The yield value change 90.1 -> 91.3 bu/acre is a combination of ideal moisture changed in calculation and plot dimensions. (372 x 28) @ 13% moisture, db uses (372 x 27.8) @ 13.5% moisture. This results in 1.3% increase.
- Plot 313 (wheat grain): The yield value change 77.96 -> 79.84 bu/acre is a combination of ideal moisture changed in calculation and plot dimensions. (377 x 28) @ 13% moisture, db uses (377 x 27.5) @ 13.5% moisture. This results in 2.4% increase.
- Plot 407 (wheat grain): The yield value change 95.02 -> 97.31 bu/acre is a combination of ideal moisture changed in calculation and plot dimensions. (379 x 28) @ 13% moisture, db uses (379 x 27.5) @ 13.5% moisture. This results in 2.4% increase.
**** 2017
- Plots 108, 206, 310, 408 (soybean): plot dimensions were adjusted in calculation. Originally, 510x29.5' was used, but now we use 510x30' for consistency. This results in a 1.7% decrease in yield for all these plots.
**** 2018
- Plot 114, east strip (corn silage): A comment about an estimated 25% of the area damaged was found in the spreadsheets, so now we account for this systematic loss. This results in an change in yield from 3.77 -> 5.03 t dm/acre, a 33.3% increase.
- Plot 312, east strip (corn silage): A comment about an estimated 10% of the area damaged was found in the spreadsheets, so now we account for this systematic loss. This results in an change in yield from 6.39 -> 7.1 t dm/acre, a 33.3% increase.
- Plot 403, east strip (corn silage): A comment about an estimated 10% of the area damaged was found in the spreadsheets, so now we account for this systematic loss. This results in an change in yield from 6.47 -> 7.2 t dm/acre, a 33.3% increase.
**** 2019
- Plot 204 (corn): Moisture percentage was originally averaged across reps for 27.3, this value is removed.
- Plots 102, 212, 313, 407 (oat grain): Originally, oat grain yields were calculated at ideal moisture of 13, the database currently will default to calculating oat grain yield at 14% ideal moisture, resulting in a 1.2% increase in yield.
- Plot 203, west strip (corn silage): Mistake found in recorded raw data. Originally lbs was recorded 2834, but correct value should have been 2934, verified with Gregg's handwritten notebook. The resulting change was 10.0 -> 10.36 t dm/acre, a 3.5% increase.
**** 2020
- Plot 401 (soybean): Yield value was originally removed because of abnormally high yield, 109.9. The database restores this value with the associated note of suspicion. The moisture value was also restored from raw data sheets.
- Plots 105, 203, 308, 406 (alfalfa): Originally moisture values used were rounded early resulting in minor changes in final yield, up to 1.1 %. Moisture values are now stored unrounded, recalculated from raw data.
- Plot 410, west strip (corn silage): A copy-paste error was discovered in the excel spreadsheets, plot dimensions used in previous year were carried over into this year. The change was reverted from 415' -> 510' for plot length, resulting in a decrease in plot yield from 9.75 -> 7.9 t dm/year, a 18% change.
**** 2021
- Nearly all plots show somewhat minor changes in yield due to rounding of final yield number in master (up to 5% change). Recalculations from raw data give unrounded numbers for storage.
