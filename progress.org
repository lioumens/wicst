** 2022 [23/23]
*** DONE Fall ANPP
**** DONE WICST Fall 2022 CS1 CS2 CS3 SI CC ANPP.xlsx
- I don't want to do bag weights.... they're coded in individual cells for all of them... not worth recording in db imo
- split into canopeo and evaluation above
- dashes assumed to be missing and 0's assumed to be zero yield, verified like half of them, and they seemed intentional
**** DONE Alfalfa ANPP 2022.xlsx
- easy copy, split into 2022_anpp_alfalfa and 2022_anpp_alfalfa_canopeo
**** DONE Cover Crop CS3 w_cl_o ANPP 2022.xlsx
- sheet 1 seems duplicate, but copied dates from there into first sheet
- pretty straight forward, but has the #value! problem, probably need to make those NA and do lots of pivots in code
**** IGNORED WICST Fall 2022 CC ANPP Canopeo Datasheet.xlsx

**** DONE 2022_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** DONE 2022_WICST_alfalfa_yields.xlsx
- converted tons to lbs, discarded original and duplicated columns, and summary columns
**** DONE 2022_WICST_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- WICST_SI info is duplicated in the WICST_core sheet, so second sheet is ignored
**** IGNORED 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yields.xlsx
- this seems like a complete duplicate of 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx in the grains folder
**** DONE [#A] Hand-harvested second cut DSA.xlsx
- they're .5^2 quadrats that were cut, 1m by .5m likely
- add a note that just says "late harvest", hand sample ignored
**** DONE [#B] 2022 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- conclusion: use the N/S averages for width. Fill in with existing values 63.7. For 2022 and 2023, use 10 minimum, and 19 for plots with double passes.
- length width are missing for many of these, need to ask if fill in or leave harvest area blank
- What is portage?
  - ignore for now..
- 115 is ignored for now.. but maybe eventually
- did not add any of these sheets yet
- saved them into =2022_harvest_prairie_wicst/115/portage= for now

**** DONE 2022_WICST_corn_grain_yields.xlsx
- conclusions logged in readme, for loss design
- some constant used in final calculations, plot size and fraction of whole plot etc
- need to incorporate some comments from the excel sheet
- deleting "calculated moisture" (avg was 23.1)
- Lexi Schank: "Some area was lost from this plot due to excessive weed growth, cultivator blight, or other confounding factors. Since we can't confirm that all of this loss is from the data section, we used the following formula to correct the area used for the yield calculation: (area of data section) * (1 - (loss area / full plot area)) = 'area excluding potential loss'"
- Gregg Sanford: "missing grab sample, used average moisture" from blocks 1-3
- Lexi Schank: "We used a different area (4 rows instead of 6) due to loss in typical data section. This is reflected in the 'width' and therefore calculated into area and yield"
**** DONE [#C] 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx
- "weights recorded for main plots included the trailer weight, and the only distinction we have for which one was used is a color description. I averaged the weights of each of the red bale wagons as well as the black bale wagons, and got the same value. I will subtract this value from the plot weight (applies to mains only) - Lexi Schank"
- save wagon weight in table? not needed right...?
- red/black wagon weights calculated and copied into separate columns
- average yield dm excludes barley
- "Weight of specific wagon not recorded, color noted. Used average weight of all AARS 'red' or 'black' wagons for calculation."
**** DONE 2022_WICST_soybean_yields.xlsx

**** DONE 2021_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- I think I should use these numbers, because there's rounding differences in FORAGe_YIELDS. it's copied over and there's only 2 decimal accurace. This data sheet
- mysterious red numbers ignored
- The DM for the massive pllot seems to come from nowhere... also the plot width is different in this file
**** DONE 2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx
- Alfalfa section was just copied.
- corn silage part is conflicting "2021_harvests_corn_silage_main", can delete the entire sheet if not correct bc the pdf file seems to match the numbers in SI (the other file)
**** REVIEW [#A] 2021_WICST_SI_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- [ ] Is width 5 or 15 though? 5 in master/yields. 15 in “trusted” source
- conclusion is to use the pdf one
- there are yields here that conflict with [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]], not sure which ones to use for the main plots
- the pdf file seems to match this one though
- rounding propogation in the pasture section, so using the source datafile
**** IGNORED Alfalfa-2021.xlsx
- ignored because it looks duplicated
- copied
**** DONE [#B] Corn_Silage_Map_Weights.pdf
- ask about the filler corn & the plot width 410.
- ignored for now.. unless they want to point out the important info to capture here.
- theres filler corn numbers here I don't see elsewhere, and the total?
**** DONE [#C] CS3_Straw-2021.xlsx
- replace with wet bag weight, so that we get rid of negative moistures
- information seems duplicated in [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]]
- ignored
- negative moistures need to resolve

**** Soybean
***** DONE 2021_WICST_Soybean_yields.xlsx
- same question about adjusting for loss across entire field, the denominator
- template ignored...
- added column for harvest loss, but need to split into assesed area, and direct loss (systematic)
**** Corn Grain
***** DONE 2021_WICST_Corn_Grain_Yields.xlsx
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2024-11-01 Fri 09:00] \\
  i think the conclusion was to disregard the filler stuff, since it's just numbers that they needed to report, but not part of experiment
:END:
- need to ask about filler in these spreadsheets? whether we want to keep track, lots of missing values
- copied in, added column for harvest loss in m2, unmerged silage rows and added column
- fixed date and harvest loss percentage of plot
- why is the denominator of the harvest loss by 60'x510' not 30'x510'. it seems like that they didn't know what region the loss happened, so assumed it was evenly spread out along both. (systematic)
- i think the conclusion was to exclude the filler corn stuff

- isnt' dry weight no bag just equal to biomass grams... what was i thinking
** DONE 2022_anpp_alfalfa_canopeo
- just put the numcuts + 1 for cut, even though not really a cut
** DONE 2022_anpp_cs3
- residue assumed to be bag weight when missing and 0 dm weight. Assumed to be part of every plot
- biomass string has all the evaluated cover crops, minus residue

** DONE 2021_harvests_alfalfa
** DONE 2021_harvests_pasture
- theres a mislabel for 2019 here, documented in data anomolies. I think they copied the moisture from 2019, grab data, but the date of sampling should actually be 2021.
** REVIEW [#A] 2021_harvests_corn_silage_ei
- [ ] 15 or 5'? corn silage main used here
** IGNORED 2021_harvests_corn_silage_main
- ignored in favor of handwritten pdf
- imported just to get original values
** DONE 2021_harvests_wheat_straw
- lots of supp, recalculate neg moistures
** DONE 2021_anpp_alfalfa
- canopeo covercrop just stated as alfalfa
- there's one dry weight that would be negative, I didn't zero it out because moisture still positive
** REVIEW [#C] 2021_anpp_rye
- [ ] assumed to be dry weights? 0 for percent moisture
- cut assumed to be 2, since 1 harvest before... but it's not a good definition for it
** REVIEW [#C] 2021_anpp_clover
- [ ] assumed to be dry weights again?
- cut also assumed to be 2
** REVIEW 2021_prairie_wicst_plots
- [ ] not sure macro or micro lengths
** IGNORED 2021_prairie_bcse_plots

** DONE 2020_harvests_corn_silage_ei
** REVIEW [#C] 2020_anpp
- [ ] shoots for component?
- [ ] assumed all dry matter?
- combined with previous harvests for cut for biomassing
** IGNORED 2020_biofuels
- there are bcse and mle data that's ignored here
- no harvest data
** 2019_harvests_pasture
- [ ] should i label method as "exclosure" instead of quadrat?
- [ ] shoots?
** 2019_harvests_oat_straw
** IGNORED 2019_harvests_forage
- pasture info is in [[2019_harvests_pasture]]
- and alfalfa is duplicated in [[*2019_harvests_forage_all][2019_harvests_forage_all]]
- the alf uses the chop date in the date,but
** 2019_harvests_forage_all
- these are related to previous, need to assemble
- [ ] verify using cut date? [[*2019_harvests_forage][2019_harvests_forage]] uses the chop date
- there's just one value of supplemental bag weight in forage used, in the left join.
** REVIEW 2019_anpp_oats
- [ ] assume these are dry weights? it's unknown i guess, left as NA
** 2019_anpp_alfalfa
- these are bio massings
** 2019_undercutting
- added method and component to the biomassing id, need to rethink it since harvest and biomassings should have yielding_id
** DONE 2018_harvests_corn
- straight forward, added comments
** DONE 2018_harvests_soybean
- soybeans in 115, saved
** REVIEW [#C] 2018_harvests_wheat_straw
- [ ] no comments for harvest loss, just the area
- bales calcualted from average of trailer bales
- recorded as a commment, the calculation trail
** DONE 2018_biofuels
- nothing tricky
- widths are probably a little different

- general copy, saved test weights
** DONE 2017_harvests_wheat
- weirdly missing length and width, possibly missing a harvest loss. areas very specific

- bale adjustment adjustment changed, doesn't change yield that much
** TODO 2017_harvests_alfalfa
** TODO 2017_harvests_pasture
- missing grab weight, but split into harvest and biomassing
** DONE 2016_harvests_wheat
- "2 separate sections due to removal of canada thistle (312x27.25 and 119x27.5)" should be loss?
- from agcal calendar
** TODO 2016_harvests_straw
** 2016_harvests_pasture
- two harvests, rest anpp
- missing coordinate
** REVIEW [#C] 2015_harvests_forage
eventually all these are accounted for.
went with master, and deleted moisture, master used .6. grabbed bale information from [[*2015_harvests_forage_moisture][2015_harvests_forage_moisture]]
- Date
  - agcal calendar has 6/17/2015
  - 2015_harvests_forage has 6/17 and 6/1
  - grab sample date was 6/3
  - hay yields use 6/3 6/19
- Yields (can't figure)
  - 112: 4400
  - 207: 4600
  - 302: 6580
  - 405: 6240 or 6380 (master uses 6240)
- Moistures from master
  - 112: 80.8
  - 207: 82.9
  - 302: 82.2
  - 405: 75.7
- mositures from 2015_harvests_forage_moisture
  - 112: 22.6
  - 207: 32.6
  - 302: 23.1
  - 405: 20.2
- this sheet has .6 moistures input
- num_bales for t14
*** Alfalfa/Oat data
- the oats harvest file only has the dry weight, and the percent moisture in master uses .5
- some of the moistures only appear in this file, so using the ones I found. If multiple, they all correspond well.
*** Wheat Straw
- there's a conflict with the straw file, but num bales match up, its "SM STRAW", but this file looks more legit,so I used these values
** DONE 2015_anpp_pasture
used cuts 2-4 from here, see [[*2015_harvests_forage][2015_harvests_forage]] for harvests
** DONE 2015_harvests_forage_moisture
- has supplemental data from forage, mixes all the pasture, and alfalfa and bales
** DONE 2015_harvests_pasture
- copied data in, joined with forage data sheets because the cuts also appear there.
** 2015_harvests_
** REVIEW [#B] 2015_harvests_corn
- [ ] confirm what the east micro plots are doing
** DONE 2015_harvests_soybean
- nothing unusual
** DONE 2015_harvests_wheat
- averaging width of plot
** REVIEW [#C] 2015_harvests_wheat_straw
- loss cols wihtout supplement
- plot 411 has conflict with [[*2015_harvests_forage][2015_harvests_forage]], 2670 vs 2660
- moistures also look slightly different from master, but only marginally, final yield not affected that much
** REVIEW 2015_harvests_rye
- [ ] biomass length/width/area
- supp info?
** REVIEW [#B] 2014_harvests_pasture
- [ ] should moisture be dropped? .6 was used in master, .18 was found in moistures sheet
  - currently left in
** REVIEW 2014_moistures_pasture
* ARL
- left off on 2013, comments/loss not explicitly coded
* Tables
** tbl_2023_biomassing
- [ ] moistures should be zero?
- [ ] how to think about "cut" for pastures vs anpp... it's just left in the field
* QA Process
1. Clean excel sheets directly, fill in unknowns with Nolan
2.
