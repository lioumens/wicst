*** DONE Biofuels
**** IGNORED 2023 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- template
**** DONE 2023_biofuels_yield.xlsx
- copied both
**** IGNORED 2023_biofuels_harvest_rawdata.xlsx
- duplicated in yield
*** DONE Fall ANPP
**** DONE Alfalfa ANPP Fall 2023.xlsx
- L10 Weights has an inconsistent bag weight, 43.34 instead of 44.34 for bag 1
- 1 m^2 quadrat
- record both weeds and alfalfa dry matter, (tilled back under)
- record raw weight harvests and bags ins eparate table
- zero out the weed dm that's negative
**** DONE Fall ANPP in CS3 Wheat.xlsx
- AD25 looks incorrect, fixed, but change in yield by 15g
- also 1m^2 quadrat, needs to be added
*** DONE Pasture
**** DONE 2023_pasture_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** IGNORED Pasture Exclosure Data.xlsx
- duplicated in yields
**** IGNORED Pasture Exclosure Raw Data.xlsx
- duplicated in yields
*** DONE RRL exports
- all ready for import into R anyway, done for this stage, revisit later?
*** REVIEW Forages
**** IGNORED _Old
**** DONE 2023_alfalfa_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** REVIEW [#C] 2023_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- everything else copied
- 1 line in core,22.5 * 2000 for harvest yield? where does this come from?
**** IGNORED Corn silage harvest datasheet.xlsx
- just template
**** DONE Oatlage bale weights.xlsx
*** REVIEW Grains
**** REVIEW [#B] 2023_WICST_wheat_yields.xlsx
- looks identical... mostly extra pivot charts than aschank
- copied
- [ ] "barley filler" in =Harvest data - Grain= sheet
**** REVIEW [#C] 2023_WICST_wheat_yields (aschank@wisc.edu).xlsx
- ignore?
**** DONE 2023_WICST_soybean_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
- one comment to keep in data
**** DONE 2023_WICST_corn_grain_yields.xlsx
- copied main harvest sheet
**** REVIEW [#C] PROJ 2023_WICST_corn_grain_yields - grs.xlsx
- ignore?
- looks like copy of corn grain yields, with few extra calculations by greg
** 2022 [19/23]
*** DONE Fall ANPP
**** DONE WICST Fall 2022 CS1 CS2 CS3 SI CC ANPP.xlsx
- I don't want to do bag weights.... they're coded in individual cells for all of them... not worth recording in db imo
- split into canopeo and evaluation above
- dashes assumed to be missing and 0's assumed to be zero yield, verified like half of them, and they seemed intentional
**** DONE Alfalfa ANPP 2022.xlsx
- easy copy, split into 2022_anpp_alfalfa and 2022_anpp_alfalfa_canopeo
**** DONE Cover Crop CS3 w_cl_o ANPP 2022.xlsx
- sheet 1 seems duplicate, but copied dates from there into first sheet
- pretty straight forward, but has the #value! problem, probably need to make those NA and do lots of pivots in code
**** IGNORED WICST Fall 2022 CC ANPP Canopeo Datasheet.xlsx
- template
**** IGNORED WICST Fall 2022 CC ANPP Datasheet.xlsx
- template
*** Forages
**** DONE Hay_Cut_Weights.xlsx
- duplicated in the alfalfa sheet with more cuttings
- need to figure out what to do with these numbers
- convert tons to lbs
- assumed second sheet was cutting 2
- added columns for trailers
**** DONE 2022_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** DONE 2022_WICST_alfalfa_yields.xlsx
- converted tons to lbs, discarded original and duplicated columns, and summary columns
**** DONE 2022_WICST_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- WICST_SI info is duplicated in the WICST_core sheet, so second sheet is ignored
**** IGNORED 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yields.xlsx
- this seems like a complete duplicate of 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx in the grains folder
**** TODO [#A] Hand-harvested second cut DSA.xlsx
- they're .5^2 quadrats that were cut, 1m by .5m likely
**** REVIEW [#B] 2022 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- length width are missing for many of these, need to ask if fill in or leave harvest area blank
- What is portage?
  - ignore for now..
- 115 is ignored for now.. but maybe eventually
- did not add any of these sheets yet
- saved them into =2022_harvest_prairie_wicst/115/portage= for now
*** Grains
**** IGNORED Soy Grain Harvest 2022 datasheet.xlsx
- template
**** IGNORED 2022 Corn Grain Harvest Datasheet.xlsx
- template
**** REVISIT 2022_WICST_corn_grain_yields.xlsx
- some constant used in final calculations, plot size and fraction of whole plot etc
- need to incorporate some comments from the excel sheet
- deleting "calculated moisture" (avg was 23.1)
- Lexi Schank: "Some area was lost from this plot due to excessive weed growth, cultivator blight, or other confounding factors. Since we can't confirm that all of this loss is from the data section, we used the following formula to correct the area used for the yield calculation: (area of data section) * (1 - (loss area / full plot area)) = 'area excluding potential loss'"
- Gregg Sanford: "missing grab sample, used average moisture" from blocks 1-3
- Lexi Schank: "We used a different area (4 rows instead of 6) due to loss in typical data section. This is reflected in the 'width' and therefore calculated into area and yield"
**** REVIEW [#C] 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx
- "weights recorded for main plots included the trailer weight, and the only distinction we have for which one was used is a color description. I averaged the weights of each of the red bale wagons as well as the black bale wagons, and got the same value. I will subtract this value from the plot weight (applies to mains only) - Lexi Schank"
- save wagon weight in table? not needed right...?
- red/black wagon weights calculated and copied into separate columns
- average yield dm excludes barley
- "Weight of specific wagon not recorded, color noted. Used average weight of all AARS 'red' or 'black' wagons for calculation."
**** DONE 2022_WICST_soybean_yields.xlsx
- easy copy
**** DONE 2022_WICST_wheat_grain_yields.xlsx
- comments to columns
- deleted teh calculated column, missing moisture was 16.3
**** IGNORED Corn Loss 2022.xlsx
- duplicated in corn grain yields
*** DONE Pastures
**** IGNORED Pasture Exclosure Data Sheet.xlsx
- template
**** DONE 2022_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- comments to column
** 2021 [11/17]
*** IGNORED 2021_RRL_analysis_wheat_straw.xlsx
- rrl pdf... going to assume there are rrl exports if we need later
*** DONE ANPP
**** DONE SI_Rye_ANPP_Spring2021.xlsx
- filled in some missing to zeros mostly
**** DONE SI_ ANPP_Clover_Spring2021.xlsx
- easy copy
**** IGNORED CoverCrop_ANPP_2021.xlsx
- template
**** DONE Alfalfa_ANPP_Fall2021.xlsx
- easy copy
*** DONE Biofuels 2021 Plot Measurements.xlsx
- copied and later will transpose and join with plot/bags
- =2021_prairie_bcse/wicst_plots=
*** DONE Biofuels Plot Weights and Bag Weights.xlsx
- =2021_harvests_prairie_wicst=
*** Forages
**** DONE 2021_CS6_Pasture_Yields.xlsx
- I think I should use these numbers, because there's rounding differences in FORAGe_YIELDS. it's copied over and there's only 2 decimal accurace. This data sheet
- mysterious red numbers ignored
- The DM for the massive pllot seems to come from nowhere... also the plot width is different in this file
**** DONE 2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx
- Alfalfa section was just copied.
- corn silage part is conflicting "2021_harvests_corn_silage_main", can delete the entire sheet if not correct bc the pdf file seems to match the numbers in SI (the other file)
**** REVIEW [#A] 2021_WICST_SI_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- there are yields here that conflict with [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]], not sure which ones to use for the main plots
- the pdf file seems to match this one though
- rounding propogation in the pasture section, so using the source datafile
**** IGNORED Alfalfa-2021.xlsx
- ignored because it looks duplicated
- copied
**** REVIEW [#C] Corn_Silage_Map_Weights.pdf
- ignored for now.. unless they want to point out the important info to capture here.
- theres filler corn numbers here I don't see elsewhere, and the total?
**** REVIEW [#C] CS3_Straw-2021.xlsx
- information seems duplicated in [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]]
- ignored
- negative moistures need to resolve
*** Grains
**** Wheat
***** REVIEW [#C] Wheat-2021.xlsx
- MISSING DATE, filled in from ag calendar from website 7/19/2021, is that correct?
- otherwise easy copy
- =2021_harvests_wheat_grain=
**** Soybean
***** REVISIT 2021_WICST_Soybean_yields.xlsx
- same question about adjusting for loss across entire field, the denominator
- template ignored...
- added column for harvest loss
**** Corn Grain
***** REVIEW 2021_WICST_Corn_Grain_Yields.xlsx
- what does filler mean in these spreadsheets?
- copied in, added column for harvest loss in m2, unmerged silage rows and added column
- fixed date and harvest loss percentage of plot
- why is the denominator of the harvest loss by 60'x510' not 30'x510'. it seems like that they didn't know what region the loss happened, so assumed it was evenly spread out along both.
* WIP
** 2022_anpp_cs3
- [ ] are these 1m2 quadrats? I've filled them in as such
