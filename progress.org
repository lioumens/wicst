- 1 m^2 quadrat
- record both weeds and alfalfa dry matter, (tilled back under)
- record raw weight harvests and bags ins eparate table
- zero out the weed dm that's negative
**** DONE Fall ANPP in CS3 Wheat.xlsx

** 2022 [22/23]
*** DONE Fall ANPP
**** DONE WICST Fall 2022 CS1 CS2 CS3 SI CC ANPP.xlsx
- I don't want to do bag weights.... they're coded in individual cells for all of them... not worth recording in db imo
- split into canopeo and evaluation above
- dashes assumed to be missing and 0's assumed to be zero yield, verified like half of them, and they seemed intentional
**** DONE Alfalfa ANPP 2022.xlsx
- easy copy, split into 2022_anpp_alfalfa and 2022_anpp_alfalfa_canopeo
**** DONE Cover Crop CS3 w_cl_o ANPP 2022.xlsx
- sheet 1 seems duplicate, but copied dates from there into first sheet
- pretty straight forward, but has the #value! problem, probably need to make those NA and do lots of pivots in code

- WICST_SI info is duplicated in the WICST_core sheet, so second sheet is ignored
**** IGNORED 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yields.xlsx
- this seems like a complete duplicate of 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx in the grains folder
**** DONE [#A] Hand-harvested second cut DSA.xlsx
- they're .5^2 quadrats that were cut, 1m by .5m likely
- add a note that just says "late harvest", hand sample ignored
**** DONE [#B] 2022 Biofuels Harvest.xlsx
- conclusion: use the N/S averages for width. Fill in with existing values 63.7. For 2022 and 2023, use 10 minimum, and 19 for plots with double passes.
- length width are missing for many of these, need to ask if fill in or leave harvest area blank
- What is portage?
  - ignore for now..
- 115 is ignored for now.. but maybe eventually
- did not add any of these sheets yet

- some constant used in final calculations, plot size and fraction of whole plot etc
- need to incorporate some comments from the excel sheet
- deleting "calculated moisture" (avg was 23.1)
- Lexi Schank: "Some area was lost from this plot due to excessive weed growth, cultivator blight, or other confounding factors. Since we can't confirm that all of this loss is from the data section, we used the following formula to correct the area used for the yield calculation: (area of data section) * (1 - (loss area / full plot area)) = 'area excluding potential loss'"
- Gregg Sanford: "missing grab sample, used average moisture" from blocks 1-3
- Lexi Schank: "We used a different area (4 rows instead of 6) due to loss in typical data section. This is reflected in the 'width' and therefore calculated into area and yield"
**** DONE [#C] 2022_WICST_CS3_straw_yield.xlsx
- "weights recorded for main plots included the trailer weight, and the only distinction we have for which one was used is a color description. I averaged the weights of each of the red bale wagons as well as the black bale wagons, and got the same value. I will subtract this value from the plot weight (applies to mains only) - Lexi Schank"
- save wagon weight in table? not needed right...?
- red/black wagon weights calculated and copied into separate columns
- average yield dm excludes barley
- "Weight of specific wagon not recorded, color noted. Used average weight of all AARS 'red' or 'black' wagons for calculation."

- mysterious red numbers ignored
- The DM for the massive pllot seems to come from nowhere... also the plot width is different in this file
**** DONE 2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx
- Alfalfa section was just copied.
- corn silage part is conflicting "2021_harvests_corn_silage_main", can delete the entire sheet if not correct bc the pdf file seems to match the numbers in SI (the other file)
**** DONE [#A] 2021_WICST_SI_corn_silage_yields.xlsx
- conclusion is to use the pdf one
- there are yields here that conflict with [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]], not sure which ones to use for the main plots
- the pdf file seems to match this one though
- rounding propogation in the pasture section, so using the source datafile

- theres filler corn numbers here I don't see elsewhere, and the total?
**** DONE [#C] CS3_Straw-2021.xlsx
- replace with wet bag weight, so that we get rid of negative moistures
- information seems duplicated in [[*2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx][2021_WICST_FORAGE_YIELDS.xlsx]]

***** REVISIT 2021_WICST_Corn_Grain_Yields.xlsx
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2024-11-01 Fri 09:00] \\
  i think the conclusion was to disregard the filler stuff, since it's just numbers that they needed to report, but not part of experiment
:END:
- need to ask about filler in these spreadsheets? whether we want to keep track, lots of missing values
- copied in, added column for harvest loss in m2, unmerged silage rows and added column
- fixed date and harvest loss percentage of plot
- why is the denominator of the harvest loss by 60'x510' not 30'x510'. it seems like that they didn't know what region the loss happened, so assumed it was evenly spread out along both.
